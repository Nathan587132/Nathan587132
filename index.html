      <h3>All about Goku</h3>
      <p>Goku, inspired by Sun Wukong, was born on Planet Vegeta. He is a Saiyan, an alien species resembling humans but with a monkey-like tail. This tail allows them to transform into a Great Ape during a full moon.</p>
      <p>Throughout his life, Goku has lost his tail three times, but when he transforms into Super Saiyan 4, he resembles a monkey once again.</p>
      <p>Goku is known for his enormous appetite, eating an entire week's worth of food in a single sitting, especially when powering up into forms like Super Saiyan, which requires vast amounts of energy.</p>

      <h3>All about Wukong</h3>
      <p>Sun Wukong, also known as the Monkey King, was born in the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit. He is a legendary character from the 16th-century Chinese novel "Journey to the West." Wukong is a monkey endowed with human-like attributes, such as intelligence, strength, and agility.</p>
      <p>His golden eyes have the ability to penetrate illusions and see malevolent beings, while his body is diamond-hard and impervious to most conventional weapons.</p>
      <p>Wukong is also known for his ability to create clones of himself from his hair and possesses magical powers that make him nearly invincible.</p>
      <p>The Buddha arranged for Wukong to be fed iron pellets when he was hungry and molten copper when he was thirsty, as part of his divine trials.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <h3>Who is Stronger?</h3>
      <p>Wukong, as a Vastayan trickster, uses his incredible strength, agility, and intelligence to confuse his opponents and outmaneuver them in battle. His cunning is enhanced by his magical abilities, such as shape-shifting and creating clones.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, Goku possesses Superhuman Strength, Speed, Durability, and Endurance. Additionally, Goku has developed Ultra Instinct, a divine ability that allows him to perceive and react to attacks before they happen, making him one of the most powerful beings in the Dragon Ball universe.</p>
