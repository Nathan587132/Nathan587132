<h1>Wukong and Goku </h1>

  Goku and Wukong are similar yet different.<br>

  <h3>All about Goku</h3>
Goku was inspired by Wukong but Goku is born on Plant Vegita<br>
  Goku is a Saiyan which is an alien that is similar to a human<br>
  but they have a monkey like tail that transform them to a great ape during a full moon<br>
  Goku lost his tail three times but when Goku is Super Saiyan 4 he look a bit like a monkey<br>
  Goku eat at least a weeks worth of food in a single sitting but this is because going Super Saiyan comsumes a lot of energy<br>
